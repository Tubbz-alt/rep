I am not responsible for any damages possibly done by this worm, I just created the software.

If you release this on your town/business/whatever the fuck, I am not responsible for you being a dumbass and deciding to release a virus on them.

Note that this worm is not harmful on its own, but it _may significantly slow down the PC that it is running on, and will overwrite all data on the drives it is connected to. (Atleast in concept, the actual infection mechanism is not implemented yet)_

This worm made by hyperbeamf. srz beniz
