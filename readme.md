I am not responsible for any damages possibly done by this worm, I just created the software.

If you release this on your town/business/whatever the fuck, I am not responsible for you being a dumbass and deciding to release a virus on them.

Note that this virus is not harmful on its own, but it __may significantly slow down the PC that it is running on, and will overwrite all data on the drives it is connected to.__
